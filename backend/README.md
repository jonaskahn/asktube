AI-Powered Summarizer, Q&amp;A Assistant on Youtube Videos ðŸ¤–

---
## Why does this project exist?

- Iâ€™ve seen several GitHub repositories offering **AI-powered** summaries for YouTube videos, but none include **Q&A**
  functionality.
- I want to implement a more comprehensive solution while also gaining experience with AI to build an RAG application for business class.
- Get rid out of langchain: Since it's a very small project, I try to avoid heavy library like langchain.
